#+TITLE: The slide source files

The slides are made by beamer and tikz, compiled by latexmk
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ make
#+END_SRC
which would produce all pages by default.

** Too slow to compile all pages in making slides?
It is true that beamer can be slow when there are many pages of your slides. A possible way to fast your process is to add label to your working-frame and compile this one or these ones only. For instance
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\begin{frame}[label=current]
Compile this one only
\end{frame}
#+END_SRC
The frames with label 'current' would be compiled only if the following macro is added in your tex:
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\includeonlyframes{current}
#+END_SRC
where you can change the label or add more different ones.

Then just call
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ make dev
#+END_SRC
