The repository contains the source files and compile recipe for making my thesis pdf. All compiling processes are via the recipe [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] with Latexmk (see, [[https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html][Using Latexmk]]). The sources are to generate:
- Thesis file: [[file:main.pdf][main.pdf]]
- Slide file: [[slides/ppgm_slide.pdf]]

/No need to go further down if you are here to view the pdf files/.

** The environment requires
*** To compile from source, you need to have the following utilities installed
- GUN Make
- Latexmk
*** bst
    Copy the bibliographystyle (.bst) file to the root directory of the repository from [[file:preamble/][preamble]] if you are not in a linux distro, since the default softlink may not invalid in your os.
*** Optional
   It is preferable to have a global configuration for your Latexmk. For install, tell latexmk which pdf viewer you want to use:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ echo '$pdf_previewer = 'start evince';' >> ~/.latexmkrc
#+END_SRC
It is possible to have local configuration for the project only, just edit the [[file:latexmkrc][latexmkrc]] here in the root directory of the repository. See [[https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html][local configuration]]. 


** Compile the dissertation from source

Default clean-compile removes cached or intermediate files made previous, and compile from scratch, just do
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ make 
#+END_SRC
The fantastic part is to have the compiling process running at backend continuously, monitoring your file change, and re-compiling at any new edited changed spotted automatically. It frees your hands from running compile whenever have write new stuff. If you want to work on the manuscript this way, just run
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ make continuous
#+END_SRC
The generated pdf is opened and refreshed automatically as well, where the viewer is specified in the .latexmkrc file.

To start the pdf viewer manually, run
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ make run
#+END_SRC

** Compile the slides from source
Just execute the following target-making in the root directory.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ make slide
#+END_SRC
Or go to the sub-directory [[file:slides/][slides]] and use the Makefile there.
