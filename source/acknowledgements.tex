\chapter{Acknowledgements}
% This Ph.D. journey would not be possible without these people to be acknowledged here.

% First and foremost, I would like to express my deep gratitude towards my main supervisor Prof. Lars K. Rasmussen. At the beginning of this journal, Lars remarked to me, 'Let us do something interesting'. This code revealed more power later as time went than it sounded at the beginning. In the long and challenging journey, it was the propulsion from interest that drove me all the way here. At the time that I lay these words to my thesis, I still feel the joy of doing what I do in research. Lars has been always supportive in advising me and teaching me the way to do research, though there were inevitably detours in research journeys. Whenever I was in moments of confusion and frustrations, Lars's positive attitude and humor brought me back to balance.

% I want to thank my co-supervisor Assoc. Prof. Ragnar Thobaben for the consistent support of my thesis writing. His comments are always insightful input and to the point. Given the overloaded schedules, Ragnar can always have them well-organized and finished on time. The work with Ragnar is efficient and joyful. 

% I am deeply grateful to Assoc. Prof. Saikat Chatterjee and Dr. Minh Th\`{a}nh Vu. There are always interesting ideas from Saikat's active mind. Fortunately, our offices are just several-step away, which allows quick discussions before the inspiration fades out. Thank Saikat for his sacrifice of weekends and holidays to help me improving my drafts.
% I own the thanks to Minh for conveying many prohibitive problems in intuitive ways in our discussions, which gradually helps to form my own way of comprehending complex issues. I am impressed by how knowledgeable this mind is and how fast the mind processes problems. I benefit a lot from working with him. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Minh for the consistent guidance of my research.
