   - [X] eq (3.10), (3.11). Not understanding comments
   - [X] eq (3.23). Adding one example to symmetric property of potentials, i.e., the Ising model.
   - [X] eq (3.36), +I think it is fine without abs insides, since p-norm operation gives the abs operation by default,+ I should use abs value notation over z - z. The correction is made.
   - [-] Interpretation to Theorem and Corollary results. A remark is added.
   - [-] quality of the fix point, add one example of coding about :

     - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=910578 
       I added a Remark discussing some cases (special graphs or graph structures) where error analysis of BP has been studied, at the end of Theorem 1.
   - [ ] Figure 3.3, pending
     - Yeah, the order of legend was generated random in the figure where I used a python library. I am leaving the trivial issue pended.
   - [X] corollary 1 comments on page 36 and page 34
   - [X] page 38 on performance of the prior trick
   - [ ] Studying Corollary 1 with consideration of the presence of the edge/connection probability? (Comment triggered by the pre-fixed edge probability in ER model)
     - yes, I agree that by further taking the edge probability into result (3.43) or (3.44). I also realized this after briefing the LDPC code references in above item. It could be useful when there is application scenarios with random connections of graphs. In practices, when a problem is given, its graphical model is usually fixed. For there cases, it may not be useful to have a convergence condition for random graphs. I am pending this. We can come back to it if the said conditions turn out to be useful for applications.
