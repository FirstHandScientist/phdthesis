** Chapter 2
   Click [[file:comments/c12main.pdf][comments on Chapter1,2]] to open commented file.

   - [X] maximal clique comment in defining MRF, an remark is added after eq(2.3), please check
   - [X] directed and undirected graphical model comparison, comment made on their representation power, thus I did revision. Please check the transition paragraph (discussion from Bayesian network to MRF), right before Example 2.1
   - [X] fix error in eq(2.4). Check if still have difficulty in reading (2.4) (2.5) (2.6)
   - [X] toy model in from three-node to four-node case

   - [X] eq (3.10), (3.11). Not understanding comments
     - [update] This is cleared during our meeting.
   - [X] eq (3.23). Adding one example to symmetric property of potentials, i.e., the Ising model.
   - [X] eq (3.36), +I think it is fine without abs insides, since p-norm operation gives the abs operation by default,+ 
     - [update] I should use abs value notation over z - z. The correction is made.
   - [-] Interpretation to Theorem and Corollary results. A remark is added (Remark 3.5 in the revised version)
   - [-] quality of the fix point, add one example of coding about :

     - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=910578 
     - [update] I added a Remark discussing some cases (special graphs or graph structures) where error analysis of BP has been studied, at the end of Theorem 1 (Remark 3.4 in revised).
   - [ ] Figure 3.3, pending
     - Yeah, the order of legend was generated random in the figure where I used a python library. I am leaving the trivial issue pended.
   - [X] page 38 on performance of the prior trick
     - cleared in meeting
   - [ ] corollary 1 comments on page 36 and page 34
     - Studying Corollary 1 with consideration of the presence of the edge/connection probability? (Comment triggered by the pre-fixed edge probability in ER model)
     - yes, I agree that by further taking the edge probability into result (3.43) or (3.44). I also realized this after briefing the LDPC code references in above item. It could be useful when there is application scenarios with random connections of graphs. In practices, when a problem is given, its graphical model is usually fixed. For there cases, it may not be useful to have a convergence condition for random graphs. I am pending this. We can come back to it if the said conditions turn out to be useful for applications.

** Chapter 4
   Click [[file:comments/c45main.pdf][commented Chapter 4,5]] to open your comments on Chapter 4,5

   - [X] Fix eq(4.3), added explanation
   - [-] An example has been add after eq(4.4), showing message update and belief calculation in GBP
   - eq(4.6). The inside term can be formulated in term of KL divergence. I follow the typical definition of region-based free energy. The current definition is fine.
   - eq(4.12), Ragnar questioned where the true b_R comes from. 
     b_R here is belief from RENN. It is an estimation instead of ground truth. The regularization is to enforce belief consistency.
   - Ragnar question after eq(4.3). The counting numbers are to balance the each region's energy to the overall region-based free energy. I do not see how this is connected to trees.
     However, a region graph is a hypergraph and is tree-structured by definition. You may see a region graph as a DAG.
   - Response to comment on page 57:
     L2 distance is used for belief regularization in cost function. L1 distance is used for assessment of marginals. It is not typo.
   - [X] +Fix eq(4.7) large {{a, x_a}}, small {{i}}+

** TODO Chapter 5
   - [ ] Cannot recognize the comment on 'We would begin with the explanation of why inference ...' the last paragraph in preamble of chapter 5.
   - [ ] *important* I re-did the math and still think the current eq(5.2) (5.4) (5.5) are correct.
   - The question on the remark after eq(5.5).
     Yes, I think a exponential distribution can always be written as log-linear in terms of product between sufficient statistics and natural parameters.
     reference: wainwright2008graphical chapter3 and wiki on exponential family
   - Chapter 5 is supposed to be a transition chapter connecting Inference and Learning, thus I am not planning literature section for this chapter, since all following chapters are about learning.

** TODO Chapter 6


** TODO Chapter 7
